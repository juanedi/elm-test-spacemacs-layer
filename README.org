* Description
This layers makes it super easy to run tests on your Elm project, using the [[https://github.com/juanedi/elm-test-runner][elm-test-runner]] package.

* Install

To use this layer first clone it into your =~/.emacs.d/private= directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:juanedi/elm-test-spacemacs-layer.git ~/.emacs.d/private/elm-test
#+END_SRC

file.
